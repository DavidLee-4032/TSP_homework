# TSP_homework
This is a little program solving TSP problems.
The following methods are used:
Double Tree method,
2(3)-opt method,
Christofides method,
NN method,
Nearest/Cheapest/Farthest method.

The following graph genetator is used:
Actual instance with solution (MP-testdata, generating a graph embedded in an Euclid plane),
Randomized generator (using Floyd-Warshall algorithm to transform into an metric graph).

The following values are evaluated:
optimal ratio (in the worst case),
AVERAGE ratio of randomly generated graph.
